description: A guide to setup URL122 with our Astro integration.

import { Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

[Basic setup](/guides/basic) is easy, but our Astro integration makes it even easier.

## 1 install

<Tabs syncKey="packagemanager">
  <TabItem label="npm">

```bash
npx astro add @url122/astro
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="yarn">

```bash
yarn astro add @url122/astro
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="pnpm">

```bash
pnpm astro add @url122/astro
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## configure

In your `astro.config.mjs` file, add the following:

```js
// astro.config.mjs
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';
import url122 from '@url122/astro';

export default defineConfig({
  site: 'https://example.com', // site MUST be defined else the integration will not run
  integrations: [
    url122({
      prefix: 'abc'
    })
  ]
})
```

For most sites this is all you need to do!

__Configuration Options__

```ts
options: {
    prefix?: string | undefined;
    idPrefix?: string | undefined;
    subPrefix?: string | undefined;
    extraPages?: string[] | undefined;
}
```

you MUST have prefix defined, it will become a required field in the next major version.

idPrefix is deprecated and will be removed in the next major version, use prefix instead.

subPrefix is the sub-prefix for your redirects, this is only needed if you are using a url122 index site to have a redirect.

extraPages is an array of pages that you want to have redirects that are not static pages, as of now url122 only generates entries for static pages. any none-preloaded pages must be added to this array to have redirects generated for them.

## How do I get my site on URL122?
Please refer to the guide [here](/guides/basic#how-do-i-get-my-site-on-url122).


## errors:

### `The @url122/astro integration requires the `site` astro.config option. Skipping.`
This error is thrown when the `site` option is not defined in your `astro.config.mjs` file.

simply add the site option to your `astro.config.mjs` file.

### `The @url122/astro integration requires the `prefix` astro.config option. Skipping.`
This error is thrown when the `prefix` option is not defined in your `astro.config.mjs` file.

simply add the prefix option to the url122 integration setting in your `astro.config.mjs` file.
